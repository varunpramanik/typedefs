This example expects you are using Deno as your runtime (because it's delightful).
&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you don't have Deno installed, you can get it [here](https://deno.com/).
&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you have Deno, you may need to make sure you have updated it by running the `deno upgrade` command in your terminal.
