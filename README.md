# typedefs
&nbsp;&nbsp;

This repository contains static copies of useful type definitions in a predictable location. I will periodically mirror downstream changes. The original licenses associated with any type definitions will be included where possible alongside links to the original source.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

Some handy supporting resources, such as `deno.jsonc` configuration files, may be included.
&nbsp;&nbsp;

All contents within this repository are provided as-is. Anything original contents, i.e. those not sourced from elsewhere, should be considered BSD Zero Clause Licensed. I hope you find them useful.
